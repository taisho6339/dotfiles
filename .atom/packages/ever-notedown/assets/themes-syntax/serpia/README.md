Taken from [https://github.com/LucasKA/sepia-syntax](https://github.com/LucasKA/sepia-syntax) and modified for EVND.

#### Sepia is lightweight syntax theme for the Atom editor, based on a few guiding principles:

- Working synergistically with Atom's new One Light and One Dark Themes
- Being pleasurable to look at for extended periods of time (I want you to like to work in it!)
- Syntax is contrasted enough to allow you to differentiate things a glance, without them stepping on each other, or blending together.
- Light, parchment style editor background for people who have glossy monitors or don't work in a dungeon all day.

If you use OSX, I suggest the Monaco font, which is not only free, but looks really great with this theme. YMMV

If you like the theme, please :star: it, or send pull requests if you think you can improve it!
