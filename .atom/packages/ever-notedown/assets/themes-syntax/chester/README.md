## Chester

A syntax highlighting theme for the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/) whose colours are totally
not ripped off from Lonely Planet's [Rizzo](https://github.com/lonelyplanet/rizzo) styles and what
do you even mean oh no please don't sue me.

There is also a corresponding colour scheme for the iTerm2 terminal emulator: [csutter/chester-iterm2-colors](https://github.com/csutter/chester-iterm2-colors).
