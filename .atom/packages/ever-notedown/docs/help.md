## Installation

### Requirements

- OS X `Mavericks, Yosemite`
- Atom `>0.197.0` <sub>WFM</sub> [^wfm]
- Evernote OSX Client `>6.0.0`
- GIT `2.1.2` <sub>WFM</sub>[^wfm] &nbsp; (Version 2+ should work.)


### Preparation
**Before installing the EVND plugin**, please consider _**Setting Up EVND Storage**_ first (assuming you already have Atom installed):  
1. Decide where you want your EVND notes (markdown text file, rendered HTMLs, images and attachments, etc.) to locate.   
  -- Personally, I would put the EVND folder in a cloud drive sync'd directory (dropbox, google drive, onedrive, etc.).     
2. Create the folder, and make a symbolic link to `~/.atom/evnd`:     
 ```bash
 $ ln -s path/to/your/folder ~/.atom/evnd
 ```
3. Enter the folder, create a file named `index.json`, write `{}` and save.    
 ```bash
 $ cd ~/.atom/evnd
 $ echo "{}" > index.json
 ```
4. Initialize the folder as a git repo (and make an initial commit if you like)    
 ```bash
 $ cd path/to/your/folder
 $ git init
 ------ Optional ------
 $ git add .
 $ git commit -m "Initial commit"   
 ```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Install
- **APM**: `apm install ever-notedown`
- **Preferences**: Open Atom and go to `Preferences > Packages`, search for `Ever Notedown`, and install it.  

&nbsp;   
&nbsp;


### Using EVND

#### First Time
If you haven't already set up the EVND local storage, it will try to create a folder at `~/.atom/evnd/` for you... or so I think. 

#### Activating EVND

To save Atom start up time, EVND will only be automatically loaded partially when you open Atom, so there might be times when you see that elements such as `[TOC]` and mathjax equations are not rendered in preview. There are many ways to fully activate EVND, e.g.: toggling the EVND panel, opening up the drop-down EVND note list, etc. 
> [**Demo**](https://www.evernote.com/l/AERzpsK7uF1EhIaMHEvwfAktAEg5xowOCwg)

#### Atom UI Theme compatibility

For now I know EVND can look kind of awkward with the One Dark/Light UI theme. Atom Dark/Light UI, Seti UI, Unity UI and Yosemite UI should be fine.

#### Shortcut Keys (General EVND Functions)

| Keyboard Shortcuts                           | Function          |
|:---------------------------------------------|:-----------------:|
| <kbd>shift</kbd><kbd>cmd</kbd><kbd>M</kbd> | Toggle Preview    |

## Features

### Communicating with Evernote

#### 2-way syncing <i class="fa fa-refresh"></i>

- Notes created in EVND: 
  - **EVND->Evernote**: Works pretty well. You can push changes to Evernote any time you want.
  - _Evernote->EVND_: You can make changes in Evernote and then load the changes back to EVND... sort of[^fn html2markdown].
- Import notes from Evernote
  - with notelink or query string [**\[see demo\]**](https://www.evernote.com/l/AESxb3MfMWlL_Iqhv7kx7PSfFuUKjIzhU2o). EVND will (attempt to) convert the notes into Markdown[^fn html2markdown].
  
#### Images and Attachments <i class="icon icon-file-media"></i>

- Insert images with pasting or drag-and-drop
- Insert attachments with syntax `!{alt text}[path/to/file "Optional Text"]` or drag-and-drop
- Special attachments (PDFs, audios) will display properly in Evernote.
- 2-way syncing! New attachments added and changes made in Evernote will be detected and loaded back to the EVND storage (e.g. annotated images in Evernote, etc.)


> `*` _Not sure how well it works with large files..._   

&nbsp;

### Note Management

You can use 2 versions of note browser:
1. A searchable drop-down list of notes. You can change the default sorting method in the EVND package settings.
  - Fuzzy search with any text in title, tags, notebook, file path, etc. (anything visible in the drop-down list).
  - Search with keywords (e.g."notebook:inbox")
2. A browser in side panel organized by notebooks with several sorting buttons. 


> [**Demo here**](https://www.evernote.com/l/AETukpDn_w1DYKIQu0GVqc29jKS5ADeCR-A)

&nbsp;

### Themes for Rendering

> [**Demo here**](https://www.evernote.com/l/AERp-6EbVWJDl5ZHzWwhll_AxrLpEFd13N4)

&nbsp;

### Extended GFM Syntax


#### LaTeX Mathematical Expressions with MathJax


##### MathJax: Basic Usage

- Inline math equations (`$...$`): $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
- Display mode math equations (`$$...$$`):
$$ 
\begin{align}
  \nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{B}} -\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{\partial t} & = \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{\mathbf{j}} \\
  \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{E}} & = 4 \pi \rho \\
  \nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{E}}\, +\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t} & = \vec{\mathbf{0}} \\
  \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{B}} & = 0
\end{align}
$$

> **Notes:** If mathjax is enabled in settings, you will need to use backslash to escape regular dollar signs: \$

&nbsp;

##### MathJax: Custom Macros

You can define your own macros or use one of the pre-defined macro files. 

TODO: Screenshot 1   
TODO: Screenshot 2   

To choose one of the pre-defined macro files, go to EVND package settings (`Atom->Preferences->Packages->Ever Notedown`), find the config option for "Mathjax Custom Macros"(see screenshot) and select from drop down list.

![Alt text](atom://ever-notedown/docs/images/clipboard_20150430_211015.png "Optional title")      
&nbsp;

Fo view current macros or edit custom macros, from the menu bar, select `Packages -> Ever Notedown -> Settings -> MathJax`. You can use the pre-defined macros for reference.

> [**Demo for MathJax & Macros**](https://www.evernote.com/l/AES5wqBjghpBh79jgzEGhqByqKD1uw64B5U)

&nbsp;

#### Table of Contents

To define a table of contents, write `[toc]` or `[TOC]` in a separate paragraph.

&nbsp;

#### Footnotes

To insert a footnote, use `[^footnote label text]`, like this[^another sample footnote], and then define the footnote by writing a separate paragraph anywhere in the document, starting the paragraph with `[^footnote label text]: `.

[^another sample footnote]: Footnote definition!

&nbsp;

#### Attachments <i class="fa fa-paperclip"></i>

Insert attachments with the syntax `!{alt text}(path/to/your/attachment/file "Optional title")`.

> - [**Demo for PDF attachments**](https://www.evernote.com/l/AESHF44qHkRANq1H4U4W9GLvMMdI7ojT2O4)
> - [**Demo for Audio Attachments**](https://www.evernote.com/l/AEQGmNV9LGNHopmiaylXNKxpKwnUhEpuujg)

&nbsp;

#### Images

Use the usual Markdown syntax for images: `![Alt Text](path/to/the/image "Optional Title")`

> [**Demo for 2-way syncing images**](https://www.evernote.com/l/AESqRZ75YFRDrojYCY5l0XNhp6EATx1Vy2c)

&nbsp;

#### Icon Fonts and Emojis

You can insert emojis like this - (`:tada:`) :tada:   

Octicons and FontAwesome are also available, use `<i class="icon icon-home"></i>` and `<i class="fa fa-anchor"></i>` and EVND will convert them to PNG images when sending to Evernote:
- <i class="icon icon-home"></i>   
- <i class="fa fa-anchor"></i>
- <i class="fa fa-university"></i>


> **TODO**: More on this... Image size, color, quality, how to customize & extend, etc.

&nbsp;

#### Fenced code blocks

You can define fenced code block in the usual GFM way. Several syntax highlighting themes are available in the package settings.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

print "Hello World!"
```

![Alt text](atom://ever-notedown/docs/images/clipboard_20150501_172409.png "Optional title")    
&nbsp;

You can also customize your own syntax theme:
> **Menu**:   
> Packages -> Ever Notedown -> Settings -> Syntax Themes (for fenced code blocks) -> Edit Syntax Theme: custom1.css 

&nbsp;

#### Tables

| Tables   |      Are         |  Cool     |
|----------|:----------------:|----------:|
| col 1 is |  left-aligned    |    \$1600 |
| col 2 is |    centered      |      \$12 |
| col 3 is | right-aligned    |       \$1 |
| See how  | the dollar signs | <u>are</u>|
| escaped? | **bold** _italic_| &nbsp;    |

&nbsp;

#### Checkboxes

You can configure EVND to render `[ ]`, `[x]` as checkboxes everywhere in the file beside is the general GFM task list `- [ ]`. Those checkboxes will be funcitoning in Evernote, and you can load changes back into EVND.

#### Keyboard Shortcuts for Text Formating

| Keyboard Shortcuts      | Format     |
|:------------------------|:----------:|
|<kbd>cmd</kbd><kbd>b</kbd>       | **bold**   |
|<kbd>cmd</kbd><kbd>i</kbd>       | _italic_   |
|<kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>~</kbd> (ctrl + shift + \`)| ~~strikethrough~~|
|<kbd>shift</kbd><kbd>cmd</kbd><kbd>U</kbd>| <u>underline</u>|
|<kbd>shift</kbd><kbd>cmd</kbd><kbd>H</kbd>| <mark>highlight</mark>|

>[**See demo**](https://www.evernote.com/l/AETNS1RKOoJMuKAg9uzLQsNqXXw4Z_zeAdw)


&nbsp;
  
#### Syncronized Scrolling

Limited but basically working...   
> [**Demo**](https://www.evernote.com/l/AEQHcoHTT-hHgqf3Ryt1JmVcfX6gstuNoSg)

&nbsp;

#### Auto tab switching
Only works after EVND is "fully" activated. Suppose you have multiple markdown files and their previews opened in split mode with markdown files on one side and previews on the other, when you switch tabs between markdown files, the corresponding previews will automatically switch accordingly. (See demo)

## What Else?

- Notes for developers?[^developers]



[^developers]: Packages -> Ever Notedown -> Helper -> Notes For Developers


[^footnote status]: **Status** - I initially wrote this for my own use, and over the course of about a year, it has become increasingly...complicated. And I'm guessing that other people might find some use with this, so I thought I'd share. I've been using EVND to write my notes, but I don't have the time or means to do more serious tests, hence I can only say the status is _**"Works For Me"**_.  

[^wfm]: **WFM (Works for me)** - Works for me.

[^fn html2markdown]: **HTML2Markdown** -  The result might vary since the function is still in a crude state. The resulting Markdown text might contain some un-converted HTML. Changes in meta info (notebook, tags) and images & attachments should be loaded just fine.

[^sample footnote]: **Sample footnote** - No big deal, just a random footnote.
